# nhanes_inferential_2023 (an error that I ran into)
**Objective**:
Analysis of NHANES data using Python in Google Colab to perform inferential statistics, explore health metrics, and examine demographic relationships. Includes code and insights in a Google Colab notebook.

**Explanation**:
Before I could get into trying to answer the questions of analysis, I had trouble loading the data from the CDC. In my code from Google Colab Notebook, I attempted to upload xpt from my local computer and tried to do it through a url and I had issues working on this assignment. I will post screenshots below.
